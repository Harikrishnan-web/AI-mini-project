# AI-mini-project
ü§ñ Python Minimax Chess AI EngineThis project presents a self-contained, graphical chess game where the opponent is an Artificial Intelligence agent utilizing the classic Minimax Algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The goal is to provide a functional and educational example of game AI implementation in Python.‚ú® Core FeaturesAlgorithmic Opponent: AI plays as Black, searching for the best move against the human player (White).Performance Optimization: Includes Alpha-Beta Pruning for drastically improved search efficiency.Text-Based Graphics: Uses Pygame and Unicode symbols (‚ôú, ‚ôõ, ‚ôî, etc.) to create a functional, cross-platform graphical interface without requiring any image assets.Modular Design: Separates the AI logic (MinimaxAI) from the visual presentation (ChessGUI) for clarity.üöÄ Getting Started1. RequirementsEnsure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.2. InstallationThis project relies on two popular Python libraries: python-chess for rules and board management, and pygame for the graphical interface.Bashpip install python-chess pygame
3. ExecutionSave the provided code as a Python file (e.g., chess_ai.py) and run it from your terminal:Bashpython chess_ai.py
üéÆ How to PlayThe game will open a new window showing the chessboard. You control the White pieces.Select a Piece: Click on any of your pieces (White). The square will be highlighted in green.Move: Click the destination square. If the move is legal, it will be executed.AI Turn: Once you move, the AI (Black) will begin its calculation. The window title indicates when the "AI is Thinking...".Game End: The game concludes automatically upon checkmate, stalemate, or other draw conditions.‚öôÔ∏è The AI Engine ExplainedThe strength and speed of the AI are defined by three components: the evaluation function, the search algorithm, and the search depth.1. The Minimax SearchMinimax is a decision rule used in zero-sum games (like chess) where one player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss.Maximizer (White): Aims to find a move leading to the highest possible board score.Minimizer (Black/AI): Aims to find a move leading to the lowest possible board score (as a high score is good for White).The process is recursive: the AI assumes you (the Maximizer) will choose the best possible move in response to any move it makes.2. Alpha-Beta Pruning (The Speed Hack)Chess has an enormous game tree. Without optimization, a depth-4 search could take minutes or hours. Alpha-Beta pruning avoids exploring branches of the tree that can be mathematically proven not to contain the best move.Alpha ($\alpha$): The best (highest) score the Maximizer is currently guaranteed at this level or above.Beta ($\beta$): The best (lowest) score the Minimizer is currently guaranteed at this level or above.The crucial rule is: If $\beta \le \alpha$, stop searching this branch. If the Minimizer finds a move that leads to a position worse than the Maximizer can already force elsewhere, the Maximizer won't choose this path, so it's irrelevant and can be "pruned."3. Evaluation Function (evaluate_board)The evaluation function assigns a numeric value to a static board position, representing its tactical advantage.$$\text{Board Value} = \sum_{\text{White Pieces}} (\text{Material} + \text{Position}) - \sum_{\text{Black Pieces}} (\text{Material} + \text{Position})$$Material: Basic point value for each piece (Pawn: 100, Queen: 900, etc.).Position: Piece-Square Tables (PAWN_W, PAWN_B) are arrays that add or subtract value based on where a piece is located, encouraging central control and king safety.4. Search DepthThe ai_depth parameter controls how many moves (plies) the AI looks ahead. The default depth of 3 provides an intermediate challenge and fast response time.DepthPlies (Half-Moves)Impact on Difficulty22Very basic; fast.33Reasonable tactics; intermediate.44Stronger positional play; slower calculation.
